# Undertale-PCB-Charm
A tiny glowing SAVE point, a manifestation of your determination, but now in PCB form!!


Inspired by the SAVE crystals from Undertale, this PCB charm/badge only lights up when you press the button **and** shine a light on it. Since I am a huge Undertale fan, this project is kinda like my tribute to the game, and also a cute little reminder to `STAY DETERMINED.`
